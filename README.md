# Numerical-Optimization
This is a course material for numerical optimization to be taught in summer 2020.

This course is intended to cover
- Various optmization methods used in scientific computing
- Julia programming

The course will mostly follow the book of [Algorithms for Optimization by Mykel J. Kochenderfer and Tim A. Wheeler](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-optimization).
Here is an intersting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofWy5kaZU3g) by one of the authors talking about how they wrote the book in a Julia confernece.

For some details on the optimization algorithms, we will refer to [Numerical Optimization by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5)
